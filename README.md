# Pinky's Peculiar Pack

Repository for Pinky's Peculiar Pack, a personal Minecraft modpack for Forge 1.20.1 focused on providing a gentle yet engaging modded experience accessible to newcomers and those looking for a lighter modded experience. This is achieved by focusing on a few large mods (The Aether, Create, and Twilight Forest) and rounding out the pack with mods that build upon Minecraft's existing features without replacing them entirely. Other pack features include an in-game documentation system on included mods, an advancement system that encourages experimentation, and various tweaks and custom features to tie everything together.
