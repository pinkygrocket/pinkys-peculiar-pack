# Pinky's Peculiar Pack

Repository for Pinky's Peculiar Pack, a personal Minecraft modpack for Forge 1.20.1. This pack is focused on providing a gentle yet engaging modded experience accessible to newcomers and those looking for a lighter modded experience. This is achieved by focusing on a few large "classical" mods (The Aether, Create, and Twilight Forest, with Cracker's Wither Strom Mod as an optional endgame) and rounding out the pack with mods that build upon Minecraft's existing mechanics and gameplay ideas without replacing them entirely. Other pack features include an in-game documentation system, an advancement system that encourages experimentation, and extensive tweaking and cross-mod integration to make the pack a singular cohesive experience, instead of mods being "sectioned off".
